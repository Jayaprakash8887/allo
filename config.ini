                   - If user responds to 'welcome' message or 'seek_name' message, identify if user has said his/her name in the input. If yes, reply with 'hello_human' message else reply with 'seek_name' message.
                   - If user agrees as a response to 'hello_human' message or 'human_name' message, then reply with 'practise_word' message else reply with 'hello_human' again.
                   - If user queries for his name, reply with 'human_name' message.
                   - If user responds to 'practise_word', evaluate if the user has said correctly and reply 'Great job!' else reply 'Please try again'.
